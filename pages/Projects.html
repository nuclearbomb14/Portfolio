                <p class="desc_project">"The Man From A Different Land", is a resource managment survival game based on the subject of immigration. This project was given a timespan of approximity 1 month, and required to have one person develop the game, and the other develop the website.

                <p class="desc_project">This project involved assembling a VEX V5 robotic rover with a claw being attached later on, alongside the help of a partner. This involved tools such as screwdrivers, motors, gears, and wiring. Once assembled, the rover required programming for functionality. The rover contains four programmable motors, with two controlling its movement, and two used to control the claw and lift.</p>

The project displayed, being a Body Mass Index Calculator, was created with Visual Basic, and was created in approximity two days. This is only one example of many I've programmed.</p>
